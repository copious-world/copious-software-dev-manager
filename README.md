# copious-software-dev-manager


This stack exists as an entry point into other tools. 
Not just a menu.

Will keep DB on the git folder, etc.
Will keep stats on languages in use.
Will provide some access to team management tools.


If something special is implemented for this stack, it may be replaced by links to other things that provide better tooling.

Tools with more stuff do not automatically classify as better. So, some of the more popular heavily sold stuff may not be accessed by this app.


Will try to provide human page apps for salient parts where possible.



 
## Install

npm install -g copious-software-dev-manager
